Device type: Apple WatchApplication: Xcode using iPhone 6s + Apple Watch Ð 38mm
Old Functionality:* The slider can move up or down to increase or decrease the length of the passwords.* The label beneath it shows the current value of the slider.* When the Generate button is tapped, the user is taken to a screen presenting their randomly generated passwords based upon the length set.* The user can go back to the original screen to generate another set of random passwords.* The settings icon takes the user to the settings screen.New Functionality:
* The user can now go to the settings screen and tap which switch they would like to turn on or off.
* Turning off a switch will prevent that set of characters from being used within the generated passwords
	Example: The user turns off all switches except the numbers. Only numbers will be in the password.  This works in any combination of switches being turned on or off.
* If all switches are off, then nothing happens
* The user can go back to the settings screen and see what changes they had made previously.
* The iPhone app now has a working application
* It has a slider, switches, and a generate button that all function exactly like the watch.
* The user can generate random passwords exactly like the watch
* The generate button takes the user to a Table which presents 20 random passwords.
* There is a back button to allow the user to generate more passwords.
